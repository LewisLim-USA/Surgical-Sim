# Surgical Sim: A CS Studentâ€™s Path into Surgery

Welcome to my interdisciplinary journey. I'm a computer science student practicing surgical skills, combining tech and medicine to prototype better tools for training and learning.

ðŸ§µ What this project covers:
- Suturing technique logs and reflections
- AI/VR ideas for surgical education
- Demos and prototypes to come

This isn't about credentials â€” it's about commitment.
