# Why This Project

I’m not a medical student. I’m a computer science student.

But I believe the future of medicine will be built by teams who understand both the body and the algorithm. That’s why I picked up a suturing kit — not to perform surgery, but to feel the discipline and calm that medicine demands.

I call this journey Surgical Sim — a mission to learn surgical skills and build med-tech tools that matter.
